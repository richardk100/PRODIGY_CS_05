# PRODIGY_CS_05
# Packet Sniffer Tool

This Python project is a basic packet sniffer built using the `scapy` library. It captures and analyzes network packets, displaying key information such as the source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and packet payload. This tool is for educational purposes, intended to help users learn about networking and packet analysis.

## Features

- Captures network packets using the Scapy library.
- Displays source and destination IP addresses.
- Identifies and prints the protocol used (TCP, UDP, ICMP, or others).
- Displays the payload data for TCP and UDP packets.
- Filters packets to only capture IP traffic.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scapy library (`pip install scapy`)

## Installation
